# UI Registry

The record of visual patterns already in use, so every component built after the first
one matches it. Read this **before building any component**; add to it after.

Token values live in `ui-tokens.md`, the rules for applying them in `ui-rules.md`. This
file is the middle layer: the concrete decisions those rules produced.

If a new component needs a pattern that is not here, prefer extending an existing entry
over inventing a parallel one. If it genuinely needs something new, add it here in the
same commit — an unrecorded pattern is how drift starts.

## Established conventions

Extracted from the components below. These are the defaults; deviate only with a reason.

| Decision | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Panel corner | `rounded-card` | cards, banners, panels |
| Control corner | `rounded-control` | buttons, inputs, toggles |
| Panel padding | `p-4` | |
| Icon ↔ text gap | `gap-3` | |
| Stacked text gap | `gap-1` | title and detail within a block |
| Icon size | `h-5 w-5` | with `shrink-0` and `mt-0.5` for optical alignment |
| Icon stroke | `currentColor`, `strokeWidth 1.75` | inherits the text colour of its container |
| Detail text | `text-sm` | secondary to a `font-medium` title |
| Border | 1px, a `*-line` token | never a shadow for flat separation |

**Never interpolate a class name.** `bg-${tone}-surface` produces no CSS, because
Tailwind scans for whole strings — and with the default palette cleared it fails
*silently* rather than falling back to something visible. Map tone → full class string.

## `StatusMessage`

`src/shared/ui/status-message.tsx` — the app's single way of stating the state of the
data. Every status in the interface goes through it; no bespoke banners.

**Tones:** `info` · `success` · `warning` · `error` · `neutral`, each mapped to its
status token trio (`*-surface` / `*-line` / `*-fg`); `neutral` uses
`surface-subtle` / `line` / `fg-secondary`.

**Three redundant signals.** Colour, icon *shape*, and text each carry the tone
independently:

- colour — the status token trio
- shape — a distinct icon per tone, never one glyph re-tinted
- text — an `sr-only` prefix (`"Warning:"`) plus the title itself

That redundancy is what satisfies "never rely on colour alone". Tests assert all five
tones produce distinct labels *and* distinct icon shapes, so collapsing two signals into
one fails the suite.

**Anatomy**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ (icon)  Title (font-medium)                 │   rounded-card, border, p-4
│         Detail text (text-sm)               │   icon gap-3, text gap-1
│         [action]                            │   action mt-2
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Accessibility contract**

- icon is `aria-hidden` — the text already says it
- not a live region by default; `live` opts into `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"`.
  A live region firing on every server render is noise, not help
- `action` is for retry only where retrying can actually help

**Domain mapping** — the component is domain-agnostic; callers choose the tone:

| App state | Tone |
| --- | --- |
| Tomorrow's prices not published yet | `warning` |
| Partial data (one source failed, or dropped hours) | `warning` |
| Stale data | `warning` |
| Provider or network error | `error` |
| Non-causation qualifier, provenance, freshness | `info` |
| No data for the selected day | `neutral` |

## Segmented link controls

`src/features/market-correlation/components/view-controls.tsx` — day and metric
selectors.

**Links, not buttons.** The selection *is* the URL, so navigating is the whole
interaction: they work before JavaScript loads and keep the back button meaningful. No
`"use client"` boundary anywhere in the control.

- group: `rounded-pill border border-line bg-surface p-1`, items `gap-1`
- item: `rounded-pill px-4 py-1.5 text-sm`
- selected: `bg-surface-selected border-line-selected text-on-action-secondary`,
  `font-medium`, plus `aria-current="page"`
- unselected: `border-surface` — a border of the same width in the container's own
  colour, so selecting an option cannot shift the layout
- label above each group: `font-mono text-xs uppercase tracking-wider text-fg-muted`

Selection is carried by border, background **and** `aria-current` — never colour alone.

## Page furniture

**Masthead** — `text-display font-semibold` title, then a `font-mono text-sm
text-fg-muted` meta line joining price area · weather location · timezone with `·`.
Those three facts are the caveats the page must never bury, so the structure states them
rather than decorating.

**Mono for data.** Geist Mono is used for times, dates, numbers and provenance; Geist
Sans for prose. Within a fixed single-family token system this is the one typographic
distinction available, and it earns its place by marking which text is instrument
readout and which is explanation.

**Provenance footer** — `border-t border-line pt-4 font-mono text-xs text-fg-muted`, one
line per source, each with a `<time dateTime>` carrying the machine-readable instant.
Shown always, not only on success: knowing the data is three hours old matters most when
something looks wrong.

**Loading region** — states what is being waited for rather than spinning, sized with
`min-h-[var(--chart-min-height)]` so the page does not jump, and marked `aria-busy`.

---

## Summary card

`components/summary-cards.tsx` — a `<dl>` grid, `sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`, gap-3.

- card: `rounded-card border border-line bg-surface p-4`, contents `gap-1`
- term (`<dt>`): `font-mono text-xs uppercase tracking-wider text-fg-muted`
- value (`<dd>`): `font-mono text-2xl font-semibold text-fg`, unit beside it at
  `text-sm text-fg-muted`
- optional note: `text-xs text-fg-muted`

**The unit is suppressed when the value is missing**, so a card never reads
`— NOK/kWh`. When a card cannot apply at all (the current hour, while viewing tomorrow)
it says so in the note rather than showing a bare dash that looks like a data failure.

## Chart container

`figure` wrapper: `rounded-card border border-line bg-surface p-4`, `gap-3`, with a
`<figcaption>` at `text-sm text-fg-muted` naming both series, their axis sides and the
date. The caption is what makes the dual axes legible to someone who cannot see the
line styles.

## Observations list

`components/insights-list.tsx` — a `<section aria-labelledby>` with an `<h3>`, then a
`<ul>` whose items use `border-l-2 border-line-selected pl-3 text-sm text-fg-secondary`.
A list rather than prose: each observation is independent and should be scannable.

## Hourly data table

`components/hourly-table.tsx` — the accessible alternative to the canvas, and required
rather than optional.

- Built on `<details>`/`<summary>`, so the disclosure is keyboard operable with **no
  JavaScript and no client component**
- `FiChevronRight` rotated by `group-open:rotate-90`, `aria-hidden`
- `<caption>` states the day, the timezone, and that `—` means *no reading*, not zero
- Hours are `<th scope="row">` so each cell is announced with its hour; column headers
  are `<th scope="col">`
- Numeric cells: `text-right font-mono tabular-nums` so decimal points line up
- Wrapped in `overflow-x-auto` so the table scrolls rather than the page

## Not yet established

- stale-data indication (nothing yet distinguishes "retrieved 3 hours ago" from fresh)
